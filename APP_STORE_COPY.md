## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is interest calculated?
Loaner uses daily compound interest, which is the standard for most loans. The formula is:
- Daily Interest = Principal × (Annual Rate ÷ 365)

Interest accrues every day based on the current principal balance.

### What's the difference between payment strategies?

**Interest First (Standard)**
Pays accrued interest first, then applies the remainder to principal. This is how most loans work. Your daily interest rate stays the same until you reduce principal.

**Principal Only**
Entire payment goes directly to principal. Interest continues to accrue. This strategy aggressively reduces your principal and immediately lowers your daily interest rate.

**Custom Split**
You specify exactly how much goes to principal vs. interest. Useful for special arrangements.

### Can I edit or delete transactions?
Currently, Loaner doesn't support editing transactions to maintain data integrity. If you need to correct something, you can delete the entire loan and recreate it, or make an offsetting transaction.

### How do I backup my data?
All Loaner data is automatically included in your iCloud Backup if you have that enabled in iOS Settings. No separate backup is needed.

### Can I sync across devices?
Not yet. Version 1.0 stores data locally on each device. iCloud sync is on the roadmap for a future update.

### Is there a dark mode?
Yes! Loaner automatically follows your iOS system appearance setting (Settings → Display & Brightness → Appearance).

### Can I use this for business loans?
Absolutely. Loaner works for any type of loan where you're the lender, whether personal or business.

### What file format is the export?
CSV (Comma-Separated Values), which opens in Excel, Numbers, Google Sheets, or any tax software.

### Do you have a Mac version?
Not yet, but it's on the roadmap.
